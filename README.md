# Fall2021_CS311

-- *UPDATE 2021-09-10* --

The CmakeLists.txt files in each sub-directory, not including Project 1, will now be only for individual testing.
The Global executable for each subdirectory will be used for running the programs against the provided test file.

-- *OLD* --

All programs stored in this repository can be compiled using the CMakeLists.txt file in the main directory. 
Each directory contains a separate project and CMakeLists.txt file specific to that directory.
